	"aboutBody": "Anatomist is the brainchild of Andrew Meyerson, an American medical student, photographer, Peace Corps Volunteer (Morocco 2005-2007), and former Arab-Israeli peace activist now based in London, England. Andrew proudly attends one of the oldest medical schools in the world - <link=\"http://sgul.ac.uk/\"><u><color=$LINKCOLOR>St. George's of the University of London</color></u></link> - home of the world's first successful appendectomy in 1735, and the alma mater of such giants of medical history as Dr. Henry Gray of Gray's Anatomy, Dr. Edward Jenner – the pioneer behind the world's first vaccine, and Dr. John Hunter – the man who brought the scientific method to the practice of surgery. When he's not studying hard to become an emergency medicine physician, he spends his spare time with his brilliant and beautiful partner Angélica (a future human rights barrister!) and their son - the most adorable cat in the entire world: Don Ricardo Carranza of New York City. Andrew’s also really into Instagram: <link=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewmeyerson/\"><u><color=$LINKCOLOR>@andrewmeyerson</color></u></link>.\n\n<b>APP DEVELOPMENT</b>\nAnatomist was conceived and designed by Andrew Meyerson. The latest app rewrite using Unity 3D was built by the extraordinary Keith Brewer with assistance from Emmanuel Omene. Previous iterations of Anatomist were completed by the excellent Igor Shutrov, Adriel Othman, and Dastan Tashimbetov.\n\n<b>TRANSLATION</b>\nAnatomist was translated by the following amazing people: Arabic Translation – Ali Aljafar of Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Chinese Translation – Laurence Wells of Hong Kong, China. French Translation – Yanis Djellal of Brussels, Belgium. Italian Translation – Matteo Melis of Siena, Italy. Spanish Translation – Jonatthan Rafael Mendoza Saldivar of Mexico City, Mexico. Russian Translation – Viktoryia Hardzei of Minsk, Belarus. In spite of our best efforts to ensure the accuracy of the translations, some errors undoubtedly remain and we apologise in advance. If you find an error in any of the translations, please take a screenshot of the mistake, and send it to us via email at andrew@anatomist.us with the correct translation. We will endeavour to correct the error as soon as possible. Also, if you’d like to help us translate Anatomist into another language that is not currently available then please let us know via email as well at andrew@anatomist.us.\n\n<b>DEDICATION</b>\nAnatomist is dedicated first and foremost to Andrew's dad, Dr. David Meyerson, who aside from being a great person and the most incredible father a kid could ever have, is also an extraordinary Cardiologist at Johns Hopkins (2015 Consultant of the Year!), national spokesperson for the American Heart Association, and he's also a lawyer and an electrical engineer as well. A HUGE thank you to him and Andrew's stepmom Irma for making this possible and for always believing in our success. Anatomist is also dedicated to Andrew's mom, speech pathologist and master baker Laney Pressman and her late husband, Dr. Norman Pressman. Thank you for your love and support of this project and for teaching Andrew how to give voice to those with traumatic brain injuries. Take Mom’s advice: “Always wear a helmet!” Norman, we'll miss you and we'll forever be grateful for your hospitality, wisdom, and guidance.\n\n<b>GRATITUDE</b>\nTo Jed Kirschbaum, the legendary former photojournalist for the Baltimore Sun newspaper (and still an all-around great guy) who served as Andrew's mentor when he was a little intern for them back in 2000, thank you so much for your guidance and support. Jed and his Sun Photo colleagues taught Andrew the critically important art of photojournalism, as well as the photo-editing skills necessary to make Anatomist possible. Take Jed’s advice: “Never steal a photograph and always leave people with their dignity.” Jed, Thelma, and George- a huge thank you for your love and your Old Bay seasoning care packages here in London. To Andrew's future mother-in-law, Esperanza, thank you for your work as a psychologist, for educating him about the psychological needs of children with disabilities and their families, and for raising such an incredible daughter. To Andrew's brother Daniel, thank you for teaching him about the work of first responders and for keeping him in line when you were growing up. He's sorry for ruining your trip to Disney World and for ending your hand-modelling career. Thanks for being such a great big brother. To his big sister Edie, Andrew thanks you for teaching him about the critically important role of palliative care in medicine and for always looking out for him. He's sorry for always making you late and at this point he really hopes you’ve stopped reading this because he'll finally admit it: you invented meatloaf chin. Lastly, Andrew wishes to thank the incredible students and faculty of St. George's Medical School of the University of London. It is an enormous honor to study medicine alongside such a talented and compassionate cohort of future doctors and it makes him so very proud to call George's home.
